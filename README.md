# PokeNotif
notifications on discord for some pokemon tcg sales from specific stores which sell out too fast to reach without notifications

current stores planned

Walmart for specifically 151
Zephyr epic for specifically sale events


The goal for this is to get responses quickly for certain sites as opposed to slowly for all sites. This means we can hard code the process for several sites for speed purposes, this does however lead to crowded and messy code.
Thats a trade-off we live with.
